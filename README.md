# üç± AI Food Detection with Nutrition Information

A web-based application that detects food items in an uploaded image using **YOLOv8**, and displays their estimated **nutritional information** (calories, protein, fat, carbs) based on a CSV dataset.

Built with:
- üß† [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) for object detection
- üß™ Flask for the backend
- üóÇÔ∏è Pandas for nutrition data handling
- üñºÔ∏è OpenCV for image processing
